                    <em>My name is <strong>Wivine Wihogora</strong>,am 26 years old,my restaurant is called  <span style="color:green"> Halal Restaurant</span> , i had an idea to create a restaurant that was more than a place that served great food. I wanted to give locals a place where they'd always feel at home,a place where they could get no-nonsense food at down-to-earth prices, and where they'd be treated right by people who had a passion to serve.
